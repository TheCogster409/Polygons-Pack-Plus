# Polygons Pack Plus
## A remake of the orginial Modpack Polygons packs made by Durf, updated and improved for the latest updates.


### This mod combines sevral features from the old packs:
Tons of shapes to use for building
Extra parts such as single block engines and switches
Lots of materials and textures for various styles in builds

### But it also has many more features as well:

**All materials in one** - No more do you have to download and add different materials to simply use a cardboard wedge! Now, all materials are in one and you use the Texture Tool to change materials, cleaning up the inventory.

**Easy shape creation** - Now, use the Shape Tool to select a shape, then click and drag to create the specific size you want. No more hotbars full of corner wedges- only one slot for all polygons!

**Thousands more polygons** - Because the Shape Tool makes showing polygons in the inventory obsolete and therefore all polygons are hidden, many more polygons can be added, going from 1x1x1 to 8x8x8!

**Backwards compatibility** - Any creations made using the old packs will be able to be loaded with this mod

**EVEN MORE MATERIALS** - All in-game block materials are now in polygon form! And more!
